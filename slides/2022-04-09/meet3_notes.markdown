## Structure & goal of the historical APL paper reading meetings

### Structure

- Beforehand you'll be given the paper of the forthcoming meeting so you can have a fast look.
- Many papers will be taken from the [JSoftware](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/) website where they have a nice collection of important and historical APL/J papers.

### Goal
- Get a deeper understanding of the founding languages of the array programming paradigm (APL, J).
- As a consequence of the previous goal, become better APLjk programmers.

## The paper

### IS APL EPIDEMIC ? OR A STUDY OF ITS GROWTH THROUGH AN EXTENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY
#### J. C. Rault and G. Demars, 1972-01-01

### a. Summary

Taken from the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/800011.808106) as is:

> An attempt is made to demostrate that the use of APL is growing in an epidemic fashion. The theory of epidemic processes is applied in an approxiate manner by means of data provided by a nearly-exhaustive bibliography given as an appendix. APL is proved to be undoubtedly epidemic.

### b. Introduction

Taken from the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/800011.808106) as is:

> The few conferences held these past years on APL have demostrated a fast growth of its use. At this time APL, as we hope this conference will show, is pervading every area of activity.

> To the dismay of the vilifiers of APL, this pattern of development resembles the spread of an infectious disease.

> The purpose of this paper is twofold: first establishing that APL is an epidemic, a commonplace assertion among APL supporters; second providing the APL community and the APL addits to-come with an extended bibliography given in appendix. To our knowledge, such a bibliography has not been made available so far.

### c. The Epidimiology of APL

> The spread of scientific ideas has already been studied in terms of an epidemi process [1, 2, 3]. A thorough theory has been laid down and applied to the study of an entire discipline such as symbolic logic [3] for a one-hundred year time interval.

> Along these lines we attempt here to apply the same theory to the growth of APL using as a database a bibliography recently compiled.

![Distribution_of_pubs_vs_ratio_of_pubs](/home/pi/Documents/APL/APL_in_BCN/meet#3/2022-04-09-135444_1920x1080_scrot.jpg  "Distribution of publications in one-year intervals .vs. Ratio of publications to authors")

> It would not be contended that this literature search is exhaustive and we are fully aware that iprovements can be made.

> This bibliography amounts to about 330 entries and 220 authors. Thus the APL epidemic process, investigated here, considers a population of 220 individuals, or infections, over a ten-year span. Taking into account that an entry may include several authors the total number of publications is 422

> Figure 1 shows the number of new contributions each year: figure 2, showing the change in the number of active contributors each year, represents the epidemic curve for APL since its inception. This curve reveals clearly that since 1968 APL is really an epidemic. This corresponds to the release of an "infectious material" by IBM, APL/360 as a class III product.

> The shape of this epidemic curve does not allow one to foresee that the epidemic will stabilize in the near future, which, according to theory, should occur when the curve ceases to increase. (In fact this curve tends to grow exponentaially).

> Figure 3 gives the yearly number of publications; if the present rate of growth is maintained this year we may expect 250 papers in 1972 with 40 new authors.

> Figure 4 indicates the yearly average number of publications per author. This ratio has increased continuously since 1969.

> The above figures should not be taken as accurate ones but ust as mere benchmarks manifesting that APL, in spite of its infectious character to certain people, is hale and hearty and thriving at a pace which may endanger soon the [bailiwicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/Bailiwich) of those die-hard fossils that FORTRAN, BASIC and other [patters](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patter) are.

### d. An Annotated Bibliography

> Perusing the appended bibliography is sufficient to be convinced that APL is present in many fields. We intend here to make general comments for facilitating the use of this bibliography.

### e. APL Implementations

> One may note the fact, which is not always well known except to specialists that APL may now be found on major computers outside of IBM:

- BURROUGHS: 23, 98, 144-46, 247, 298
- CDC: 58
- CII: 157-8, 181-2, 195-6, 198
- DEC: 216
- HONEYWELL/GE: 96
- IBM: 22, 59, 77-80, 82, 312, 331
- UNIVAC: 339
- XDS: 21, 242-43, 285, 340
- Microprogrammed APL machines: 16, 45, 102-106, 203, 207, 295-297

### f. APL Compatible Terminals

> A wide range of APL compatible peripherals are available. Reference 177 gives a nearly complete list of them (48, 62, 86, 101, 188, 250, 307).


### g. APL Handling Capabilities

> Users of APL quite early have demanded facilities to work with large collections of data under program control. A number of file systems have been experimented or are presently available (37, 63, 84, 179, 189, 202, 262, 334, 338).

### h. APL Handbooks

> Many books, handbooks, user's manuals, videotapes and other materials are available: 6, 10, 23-24, 42, 78-80, 95, 112, 140-2, 205, 219, 232, 235-38, 320-323, 329.

### i. Conclusions

> Aside from the polemical aspect of this paper aimed to pique APL detractors, hope that it will be a contribution to the spreading of APL. We propose that this bibliography to be augmented, improved and refined, possibly with the help of a [KWIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context) index.

> In the following we give for the most significative fields of application, the appropriate references where the reader may find more details:

## Discussion & questions

### Questions
- Why do you think that APL has stopped being an epidemic as the article claims that it used to be from 1962 to 1972? If APL was an epidemic in the 70s what do you think was the cure?
- Which programming languages today you think could be thought to be spreading as fast as an epidemic?

### Future work
- Do a bibliometric analysis of 10 most popular programming languages of today using an array programming language and compare the results of that analysis with an epidemic model over a population of equal size.
- Try to see if it's thus possible to reach similar conclusions for any of the 10 most popular languages of today.
- As a continuation of this study, perhaps do the same for the 50 most popular languages of today, and see how epidemic-like are any of the functional programming languages of today (Haskell, Erlang, Elixir, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, etc).
- Reproduce the results of this paper by digitizing the APPENDIX of the paper and plotting the bibliometric results. Also compare with various infectious disease spreading models.
